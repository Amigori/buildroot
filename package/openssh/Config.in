	help
	  If you disable this option, the init script will not be installed
	  and as a result the OpenSSH daemon will not be started at boot.
	  Also the host key generation on first boot is skipped.

	  This is useful if you only want OpenSSH for the client programs
	  or if you use Dropbear as the SSH server but want to add SFTP
	  support.
